        <h4>SHERLOCK HOLMES</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Sherlock Holmes</b> is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring
            to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation,
            forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases
            for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.
            <br>
            <br> Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known, with Guinness World Records
            listing him as the "most portrayed movie character" in history. Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many
            have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual; numerous literary and fan societies
            have been founded that pretend to operate on this principle. Widely considered a British cultural icon, the character
            and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the
            original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio
            plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.
